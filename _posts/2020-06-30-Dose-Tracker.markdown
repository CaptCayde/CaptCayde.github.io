### Concept Design

Dose Tracker is a project I started for a design challenge while studying UX. It is an app that would help people remember to take medications as well as when and if they took them.

### Problem Statement
<p></p>

#### For Users
The primary pain point experienced by those who take medication or supplements is being able to remember to take them, when to take them, and being able to keep track of if they took them.

### User Research
<p></p>

#### Interviews
I started interviewing groups of people who have had experience with taking medications for various reasons and the number one issue that came up throughout them all was their inability to stay consistent with taking them.

#### Affinity Map
Utilizing an affinity map I saw a lot of trends among the users that I interviewed. They shared pain points and concerns relating to taking their medications daily. I then created two personas to embody those who this app would benefit the most.

1. **Dawna** is a very busy mother who sometimes forgets the little things

2. **Luke** is an active, always on the go type of guy who doesn’t have time to stop.

### Design
#### Sketches
The first step in my design process is to sketch out as many ideas as I can while thinking about all the ways to alleviate the pain points of the users. Sketching out ideas also helps me figure out ideas for user flows and highlighting their happy path for using the app

#### User Flows/Task Flows
Before moving on to wireframes I developed user and task flows for the project’s personas to get a better idea of what kind of frames I would need for the app. The task they were to perform was to create a recurring tracker for their medication allowing their phone to remind them of what and when to take their medication.

#### Wireframes/Usability Testing
Initially I created a flow of about twenty frames having the user go through 6 or seven steps to complete the tracker. But because I was conducting usability tests while designing my wireframes I was able to simplify and condense those frames. Conducting

#### Design Decisions
For this design I wanted it to be approachable for users of all ages. I used slightly bigger font sizes and buttons for users who have trouble with their sight. I used common conventions wherever possible as not to throw the user off by seeing something new and unknown.

#### Deliverables
For this project my deliverable was a mid fidelity mockup and presentation of my research. If allowed more time with it I would have brought the design further into higher fidelity while testing out new features as in uploading prescriptions with all drug info and warnings for the users. But for now the app accomplishes its initial goal of reminding users of what and when to take their medication/supplements.
