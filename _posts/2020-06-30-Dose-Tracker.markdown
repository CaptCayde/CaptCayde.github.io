### Concept design

Dose tracker is a concept design aimed at assisting users with when and if they have taken their meds.

### Problem Statement
<p></p>
Medications are most useful when taken at their prescribed time, but it’s not always easy to remember to do so. It can be hard to track especially when taking multiple prescriptions that require different lag times between doses.

### User Research
<p></p>

#### Interviews
I met with a number of patients to conduct interviews about their experience with prescriptions. My efforts revealed that the number one issue with taking medications was to consistently take the right meds at the proper time.


#### Affinity Map
Utilizing an affinity map I saw a lot of trends among users that I interviewed. They shared pain points and concerns relating to taking their medications daily. I then created two personas to embody those who this app would benefit most.

*Affinity Map*

1. **Dawna** is a very busy mother who sometimes forgets the little things

2. **Luke** is an active, always on the go type of guy who doesn’t have time to stop.

### Design
#### Sketches
After interviews I began sketching possible task-flows that would address the problems patients were experiencing. This helped me identify possible user-testing scenarios I could test down the road.

#### Wireframes/Usability Testing
Initially I created a flow of about twenty frames having the user go through 6 or seven steps to complete the tracker. But because I was conducting usability tests while designing my wireframes, I was able to simplify and drastically reduce the steps based on customer feedback. Employing the RITE (Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation) method, I was able to make incremental improvements and immediately evaluate how they affected the tests. Ultimately this resulted in a more sound design.

#### Deliverables
For this project my deliverable was a mid-fidelity mockup and presentation of my research. If I were to develop this further, I would have liked to look into streamlining the experience even more. For example,  partnering with pharmacy companies to automatically assign prescriptions through the app or integrating with smart home technology to ensure a successful alert reaches the user.
