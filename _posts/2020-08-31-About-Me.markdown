### Welcome to my portfolio

Hello, my name is Spencer and I’m a Seattle-based UX professional. My passion is in building elegant and helpful designs that solve customer needs. After studying philosophy and art at the University of Washington, I developed an appreciation for the relationship between human nature and well-designed products. People, or more specifically, what drives or motivates them is the key to your app/website/company’s success. As Plato said, “The beginning is the most important part of the work”. So, I’m looking for opportunities to work with teams that consider design at the very forefront. Let’s connect.
