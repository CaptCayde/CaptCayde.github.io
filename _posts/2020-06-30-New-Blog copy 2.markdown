### A little about myself

![myself](/images/aboutme/myself.png)

I am a UX designer. I studied Philosophy for the last four years. I enjoyed ethics and reading Plato, especially about Socrates. I have done freelance work in web design mostly for non-profits, helping clients bring their vision to the web. Along the way while attending college I worked as a mobile expert for T-Mobile where I got to help alleviate pain points customers had. I have always enjoyed talking with people to try and understand them. I believe that helps me perform better in my work.

Now working in design I try to take that experience and apply it to my designs. I want to do the heavy lifting for the users to ensure that they have the best experiences possible. It is not enough for something to work, it needs to work better than anything else before it. Whether it is a new design or a redesign it should be crafted to meet the needs of the user.

When I am not designing something, you can find me playing board games (my current favorite is Root) or prepping for my next D&D session.
