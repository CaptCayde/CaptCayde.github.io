### Creating a videogame from skratch.

Using the Unity game engine and applying UX methods.

### First things first

#### Problem Statement
<p></p>

I have always been an avid gamer and the thought of creating my own game was something that really appealed to me. Having some downtime while socially distancing during COVID-19, afforded me the opportunity to try game development/design for myself.

When I started this project I wanted to go through the entire process of making a game. This appealed to me, in particular, because it touches so many mediums. Getting to design the art, music, game concepts, even code is a lot of work, but very rewarding.  As a usability designer, I also wanted to leverage UX methodology to test, sketch, and iterate on the game.

#### Research
<p></p>

With all my projects I start with research. Having a basic knowledge of how the Unity Engine works, I looked for video tutorials and online classes on building games from the ground up. One content creator that really had helpful tips was Black Thorn Productions (blackthornprod). I really appreciated their style of teaching and it helped me explore my ideas.

#### My Idea
<p></p>

As this was my first time building a game, I knew I needed to keep it simple. After some consideration, I settled on creating a 2d platformer. In order to keep focused and limit scope creep, I knew that a 2d game would make asset creation easier. These games are also a personal favorite of mine having grown up on old favorites like Castlevainia and Metroid and new favorites such as the Ori series and Hollow Knight.

#### Theme
<p></p>

I looked through my old sketches on Procreate and found one I had titled Fire Knight. My inspiration for Fire Knight was a 2d-platformer protagonist, so it was a natural fit and I was glad to have held onto it.

Because this was intended as a small game aimed at just going through the process and learning, I kept the story simple: A lost fire knight searches an old castle filled with dark power for the rare green flame.

#### Art
<p></p>

Originally I wanted to have entirely hand-drawn art for the game, as I prefer that direction artistically, however I decided to use Figma as I was more familiar with it and could develop the needed art assets more quickly. It was actually a challenge to force myself to not spend too much time with the art - intently focusing on execution and time-boxing the effort was key.

#### Coding
<p></p>

One of the biggest challenges I faced making the game was coding in C#. Lucky for me it was similar enough to Java, a coding language I had more experience with. Having coded before I know there's never a perfect way to code something and close to a million different ways to code any given thing. While I was working on the player script, which would allow my character to move, jump, and interact with the world, I realized just how complicated coding even a simple jump and attack action could be.

*Scripts used to control the Player*

Even though it was relatively easy to look up lines of code to solve the problems I was facing I challenged myself to try and figure them out on my own. I have found the best way to really learn how to code something is through trial and error. Being able to think through ways of coding different methods can really be effective. Of course the internet is also a coder’s best friend when referencing Unity’s API and seeing relevant examples.

#### First Iteration
<p></p>

![Prototype](/images/Fire/Prototype.png)
*Screen from first iteration*

After a lot of time and effort, I had a functioning prototype with simple enemies for the player to challenge along with some platforms to jump around on. I showed it to a couple of people and got a lot of feedback and suggestions. The biggest concerns were:

1. Controls feel unresponsive.
2. The game looks too dark.
3. There was a game-breaking bug with the flying horse that crashed the game.
4. What are the controls?

A big part of designing anything is testing and iterating. With just a handful of testers, I found out a lot of things that were breaking the game. With everyone that played, I found myself always having to show them the controls which for a UX designer when a user doesn’t know what to do it's a big red flag.

I decided to go back to square one and start over with everything I had learned. It was difficult to disregard segments of work I had already completed, but I knew my next attempt would be better. I needed better organization, cleaner scripts, and a better color pallet that would make the game pop.


### Back to the drawing board
<p></p>

I went back over the assets in Figma and tried to go for a more hand-drawn look that would be more compelling. To improve the colors I worked on several pieces of concept art to reference as I reworked the game’s palette and mood.

I wanted the knight to be more playful and less serious. I really wanted that dark gloomy feel out of the game and something more fun and friendly. The best way I could do that was to take away the knight’s ax and replace it with a fireball. I mean, how else would a fire knight destroy his enemies? I also shrunk him down - which I learned is a common strategy in video games to make something friendlier and less threatening.

*New Scenery Assets*

Making a variety of assets with heavy stroke lines gave the game depth making its scenery a lot more interesting to look at while giving it a hand-drawn look.

#### Animations
<p></p>

While animating my creations was one of my favorite parts of making the game it came with challenges. The type of animation I used is called puppet animation, which is done through the game engine as opposed to looping hand-drawn animations. Since almost everything in the game used fire I was able to stretch and flip around the images to give the fire a burning look. You can click the link below to watch the animations in action.

#### Sound Effects
<p></p>

I used Garageband to create the soundtrack you hear within the game. It features a simulated electric piano and string instruments that I put together on my Ipad. Other sound effects I have for jumping and attacking I got from Freesound.org where you can download free effect sounds.

#### Bug Fixes
<p></p>

Although I played the game repeatedly to find bugs and ways to ensure it was a good experience for players, I always discovered the most impactful changes needed when observing others. I’m thankful to family and friends that let me obsessively bother them to learn more about how my game performed and observe their reactions to it. User testing is tough during a pandemic. But it certainly led to some awesome enhancements - including adding display controls and helpful hints as the player encounters new things in the game.

### Conclusion & Next Steps
<p></p>

I plan to continue to work on the game when I have time to test and iterate. I want to implement boss fights, an inventory system, and also fine-tune the controls and animations. Having gone through the process of making a video game and all its different parts is a huge process and I have a new appreciation for those who work on them. I will continue to learn and expand my skill set for making games and hope to share bigger and better ones for years to come.
