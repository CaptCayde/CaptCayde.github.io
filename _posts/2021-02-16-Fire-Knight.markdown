### Learning new skills creating a game from skratch.

My first video game using the Unity game engine. Applying UX methods to game creation.

### First things first

#### Problem Statement
<p></p>

I have always been an avid gamer and have always wanted to make my own games and right now having a little time on my hands I wanted to fulfill that dream.

When I started this project I wanted to go through the entire process of making a game. Everything from concept to reality with all the nuts and bolts in between. Having experience as a usability designer I wanted to apply methods I have learned to test, sketch, and iterate to improve the game's design.

#### Research
<p></p>

With all my projects I always start with research. Having a basic knowledge of how to use the Unity engine I looked for video tutorials and online classes on how to build games from the ground up. Blackthronprod, a youtube content creator, had a lot of helpful videos and courses that I learned a lot from.

#### My Idea
<p></p>

I wanted to build something simple for my first game. A 2D platformer felt like the right choice for two reasons. First, a 2D game felt easier to make than something in 3D and second Metroidvania platformers is a favored genre of mine so it was something that I felt passionate about. Games like Hollow Knight and the Ori series were my biggest influences for Fire Knight.

#### Theme
<p></p>

I looked through my old sketches I had made on my iPad using a program called procreate and found one I had titled Fire Knight. When I originally sketched the Fire Knight some time ago it was always my intention to use it as a video game protagonist so it worked out perfectly.

The story of a lost fire knight searching an old castle filled with dark power for the rare green flame.

#### Art
<p></p>

I had decided to use Figma for my sprite sheets and art assets that would be used in the game. Having hand-drawn art would have been preferable but the limited time I had to dedicate to building the game using Figma allowed me to produce assets faster.

#### Coding
<p></p>

One of the biggest challenges I faced making the game was coding in C#. Lucky for me it was similar enough to Java, a coding language I had more experience with. Having coded before I know there's never a perfect way to code something and close to a million different ways to code any given thing. While I was working on the player script, which would allow my character to move, jump, and interact with the world, I realized just how complicated coding even a simple jump and attack action could be.

*Scripts used to control the Player*

Even though it was relatively easy to look up lines of code to solve the problems I was facing I challenged myself to try and figure them out on my own. I have found the best way to really learn how to code something is through trial and error. Being able to think through ways of coding different methods can really be effective. And when all else fails search for answers online.

#### First Iteration
<p></p>

*Screen from first iteration*

After a lot of time and effort, I had a functioning prototype with simple enemies for the player to challenge along with some platforms to jump around on. I showed it to a couple of people and got a lot of feedback and suggestions. The biggest concerns were:

1. Controls feel unresponsive.
2. The game looks too dark.
3. There was a game-breaking bug with the flying horse that crashed the game.
4. What are the controls?

A big part of designing anything is testing and iterating. With just a handful of testers, I found out a lot of things that were breaking the game. With everyone that played the game, I found myself always having to show them the controls which for a UX designer when a user doesn’t know what to do it's a big red flag.

I decided to go back to square one and start over with everything I had learned. It was hard to move on but I knew my next attempt would be better. I needed better organization, cleaner scripts, and a better color pallet that would make the game pop.


### Back to the drawing board
<p></p>

Back in Figma, I wanted to try and give my game a look of being hand-drawn so that it wouldn’t end up looking so blocky as my first prototype. I found brighter more striking color pallets and made a concept piece to help me focus on a specific style.

*New Sprite Sheets*

I wanted the knight to be more playful and less serious. I really wanted that dark gloomy feel out of the game and something more fun and friendly. The best way I could do that was to take away the knight’s ax and in its place, I gave the knight a fireball, because how else would a fire knight destroy his enemies? I also shrunk him down which is a common trend in video games whenever you want to make something friendlier and less threatening.

*New Scenery Assets*

Making a variety of assets with heavy stroke lines gave the game depth making its scenery a lot more interesting to look at while giving it a hand-drawn look.

#### Animations
<p></p>

While animating my creations was one of the best parts of making the game it came with challenges. I used a method called poppet animation to liven the characters. Since almost everything in the game used fire I was able to stretch and flip around the images to give the fire a burning new look. Check out the video to watch the full demo.

#### Sound Effects
<p></p>

I used Garageband to create the soundtrack you hear within the game. It features a simulated electric piano and string instruments that I put together on my Ipad. you can download the song here.

#### Bug Fixes
<p></p>

Throughout the game, I tested it more and more, often with others when available but a lot I did have to do myself as I corrected bugs and rewrote lines of code. But I always learned more by watching others play the game. I was able to implement a map of the controls for the players and hints throughout the game based on whenever a player asked me a question. I felt it necessary to try and show the player the answer either through hint text or visual cues.

### Conclusion & Next Steps
<p></p>

I plan to continue to work on the game when I have time to test and iterate it as well as adding more and more to it. I want to implement boss fights and an inventory system, as well as fine-tune the controls and animations. Having gone through the process of making a video game and all its different parts is a huge process and I have a new appreciation for those who work on them. I will continue to learn and expand my skill set for making games and hope to share bigger and better ones for years to come.
