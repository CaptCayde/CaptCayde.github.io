### Adding value through customer research

Meeple Manor is a local store that has an e-commerce site that sells a variety of board games. Their site is meant to help drive their sales and help promote their in-store events.

### Problem Statement
<p></p>

#### For Customers
The primary pain point experienced by customers on this site is its *Information Architecture*. The logical grouping of games did not match the mental model of its patrons. A successful redesign will include improvements to how users find and discover board games.

#### For the Business
The business's goal is to highlight their latest products, back in stock items, and their in-store events. These pipelines are their most profitable. Therfore, it's essential that all who vist the site are exposed to this information.

### User Research
<p></p>

#### Usability Testing
My first step was to conduct usability studies. I documented a list of tasks that each participant would complete. I planned to track both quantitive success metrics and record observations. I encouraged each tester to *think-aloud* as they went through the series of tasks. Here were some of the more prominent findings:

1. All participants had difficulty finding a specific game.
2. 60% of participants were unable to find the search bar.
3. 80% of participants were unable to see when the next Magic event would take place.

#### Card Sort
Because the most critical design flaws of the site were related to findability and game categorization, I organized a card sorting exercise. Utilizing a web application called *Optimal Sort*, I distributed the card-sorting survey to a broad group of users with varying levels of board game expertise. This activity yielded the information required to re-map Meeple Manor's IA.

#### Personas
After synthesizing the data, there were 2 primary personas that emerged...

1. **Amy** loves board games for their ability to make social meetups more fun.

2. **Mike** is a very experienced board game enthusiast who's always looking for the latest games.

### UI Redesign

#### Sketches
Instead of going directly to higher-fidelity mocks, I wanted to generate a lot of possible solutions quickly. *Sketching* provides an opportunity to ensure I don't zero in on a solution without considering enough options. Additionally, I brought back previous test participants to take a look at a bunch of potential solutions.

#### Wireframes
When I progressed to wireframing, there were several key areas I knew I wanted to improve about the site. In particular, I was concerned about the presentation of the *calendar* of events. In the original design, it was below the fold, utilizing Google's calendar plugin. The lack of branding and positioning didn't help it stand out and was easily ignored by users. So in the redesign, I wanted a more custom look and prominent position.
 
I also knew that the placement of *search* needed to be more conventional to what customers were used to. Testing showed that most looked for this functionality in the top navigational bar.

#### Final Redesign
In the final designs, I was really looking to deliver a stronger brand that would be remembered by its visitors. Part of the appeal of a local board game store is the community that is built around sharing a game table. When customers visit the website, it's an extension of that community and builds loyalty to Meeple Manor. Not only should it be simple to use, but when gamers visit, they want to identify with the brand and their community.
