The first challenge I found through usability testing was that the site was hard to navigate and did not look trustworthy.

I learned through user interviews how people preferred to buy board games and what sites they would normally go to. I was able to look at what competitors were doing and learned from them what users enjoyed. 

I was able to create two user personas from my synthesizing my data. Meet both Mike and Amy.

They helped me focus my efforts on the main pain points to address in the redesign. The biggest concerns being navigation and information. From there I was ready to start sketching out possible solutions.

I put together a mid-fidelity prototype to text with the site’s users and was able to get valuable feedback about what they expected to see and what they would have liked to see. Here is one of the concerns I focused on.

Catigoring the main page into simple distinct parts gave users an idea on the site’s main purpose eliminating confusion on what the site is for.

Adding simple filtering options to allow users to find what they need faster and placing game information about player count, the time it takes to play,  and age limitations gave users security in knowing where they were going.

A lot of little but important things were added to the site to bring it up to date with what is expected of a e-commerce site today. Things like breadcrumbs, top bar navigation, and color changes. All to give clear instructions to the user about where they are, where they can go, and how to get back.

The last step on this redesign was being able to deliver a new style guide along with a high-fidelity mock-up to the client of course given more time I would have loved to add more features that every e-commerce site should have like user reviews and a wish list section. But having put only 180 hours into the project I felt good about what I delivered as a great start.
