### A Design Sprint Challenge

I was a part of a team design sprint that lasted two weeks where we were challenged to integrate Home Depot's DIY web section into the app. I worked on conducting user research, sketches, and wireframes.

### Problem Statement
#### For Customers
Customers are frustrated with the existing Home Depot app because of its lack of support for DIY projects always redirecting the app users to the website which is organized poorly for mobile browsing. Integrating the Home Depot’s DIY tools into the app would help mobile users looking to buy more supplies and find instructions eliminating the need for them to use their desktop.

#### For the Business
Their goal is to give their customers a mobile experience of their website’s DIY tools to better serve their customer base that uses the app. By this they hope to drive use and popularity for their app.

### User Research
#### User Interviews
I started my research conducting interviews to find out more about how people used the existing app and what their pain points were. Even if my team and I were charged with designing a new DIY section of the app I wanted to make sure that this was the direction that our user base wanted changes for. I was able to get the sense that the biggest pain points were finding solutions to their DIY projects and making sure they had all the materials that they needed. Most users went straight for google or youtube when they were stuck on a project and I knew this to be a place for Home Depot to improve their app and give their customers more value.

#### User Personas
As a team we went through the data we had each collected and found enough trends to create two personas to focus our efforts. Our data showed the need for an easier way to buy the materials needed for DIY projects and that the users wanted a place to explore new DIY projects.

### Design
#### Sketches
My team and I performed a few design studios where we explored different approaches to solve the problems of our users. I worked on sketching a navigation menu to lead users through the process of finding new projects and getting the right tools and instructions to help bring their projects to fruition.

#### Wireframes
After deliberation of all our ideas we needed a way to test out our designs with users and to do that we needed wireframes. That’s where most of my work came into play. I took my teams ideas and sketches and translated them into wireframes for our prototype. It was very important to my team and I that we continued to test out and iterate our design to make it as polished as possible.

#### Deliverable
After a short two weeks my team and I delivered our mockups and prototype. If given more team time we would have loved to bring the design to a higher fidelity and always test more to align the look and feel of the app to its user base.
