### Design Sprint Challenge

I took part in a team design sprint aimed at integrating Home Depot's DIY web section into their mobile app. I conducted user research and provided sketches and wireframes.

### Problem Statement
#### For the Customers
Customers are frustrated with the existing Home Depot app because of its lack of natively supporting DIY projects. When users try  accessing it, the app redirects to a non mobile-friendly version of the website. Integrating Home Depot’s DIY tools into the app would satisfy users by not fragmenting their experience and doing away with tedious desktop-only instructions.

#### For the Business
Provide customers more accessible tools to drive additional sales through both discoverability of relevant products and informing them on project needs.

### User Research
#### User Interviews
Discussing the mobile experience of Home Depot with customers yielded some interesting findings. Primarily, I discovered that customers often were unsure of all that was needed in order to complete their DIY project. Rather than use Home Depot's tools, they would opt for a google or youtube search to find the information they needed. Oftentimes the sources they would find might lead them to another store to make their purchase. This was an example of how an ineffective design cost them real money. In the words of Jaguar’s CEO, Ralf Speth:

> “If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design.”

#### User Personas
Research led to the creation of two personas. One that was focused on identifying all products needed versus another concerned primarily with discovering new ideas.

### Design
#### Sketches
My team and I collaborated on the design as we explored different approaches to solving user issues. I provided several iterations of navigation that lead users through the process of finding new projects, getting the right tools, or instructions to help bring their projects to fruition.

#### Wireframes
The sketches informed the next step in the design process as I began creating wireframes. It was very useful to rely not only on my own efforts, but those of the team’s to generate the best options for the design. I also appreciated getting their feedback as I rapidly iterated on the final designs.

#### Deliverable
For a short exercise, I was pleased with the results our team was able to generate on this project. Given more time, I would have liked to work more on the visual fidelity of the mocks and follow up with customers on our results in the context of using the app.
